# gcp-audit

The GCP Audit project automates many of the audits found in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark. There is one script per benchmark. The script is named after the corresponding benchmark. The scripts can enumerate all projects in an organization and scan each project, or the user can pass in the project as a parameter.
